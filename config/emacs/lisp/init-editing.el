;;; init-editing.el --- Basic editing configuration -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; This file is pretty simple, it only contains editing related utilities and preferences.
;; It's still experimental and very poor, so I only consider it a starting point.

;;; Code:

;;
;;; Windows/frames

;; A simple frame title
(setq frame-title-format '("%b â€“ Emacs")
      icon-title-format frame-title-format)

;;
;;; Scrolling

;; Enable smooth scroll
(unless (version< emacs-version "29")
  (pixel-scroll-precision-mode 1))

;; General tweaks
(setq scroll-preserve-screen-position t
      ;; Emacs spends too much effort recentering the screen if you scroll the
      ;; cursor more than N lines past window edges (where N is the settings of
      ;; `scroll-conservatively'). This is especially slow in larger files
      ;; during large-scale scrolling commands. If kept over 100, the window is
      ;; never automatically re-centered.
      scroll-conservatively 101
      hscroll-margin 2
      hscroll-step 1
      scroll-margin 0
      ;; Reduce cursor lag by a tiny bit by not auto-adjusting `window-vscroll'
      ;; for tall lines.
      auto-window-vscroll nil
      ;; mouse
      mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(2 ((shift) . hscroll))
      mouse-wheel-scroll-amount-horizontal 2)

;; More performant rapid scrolling over unfontified regions. May cause brief
;; spells of inaccurate syntax highlighting right after scrolling, which should
;; quickly self-correct.
(setq fast-but-imprecise-scrolling t)

;; Horizontal scrolling tweaks

;; Horizontal scrolling mouse events should actually scroll left and right.
;; (setq mouse-wheel-tilt-scroll t)
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<mouse-6>") (lambda ()
;;                                     (interactive)
;; 				    (if truncate-lines (scroll-right 1))))
;; (global-set-key (kbd "<mouse-7>") (lambda ()
;;                                     (interactive)
;; 				    (if truncate-lines (scroll-left 1))))

;;; Prog-mode preference for truncating lines
;; (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'(lambda ()
;;                              (setq truncate-lines t
;;                                    word-wrap nil)))

;; Editing enhancements for `prog-mode`
