;;; early-init.el --- Early Init File -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Early init file has been introduced in Emacs 27, it is a file loaded
;; before GUI is initialized, so unwanted elements are here.
;; Example: scroll-bars, fringes, menu-bar, tool-bar.

;;; Code:

;; A big contributor to startup times is garbage collection. We up the gc
;; threshold to temporarily prevent it from running, then reset it later by
;; enabling `gcmh-mode'.
(setq gc-cons-threshold  most-positive-fixnum)

;; From DOOM
;; Prevent unwanted runtime compilation for gccemacs (native-comp) users;
;; packages are compiled ahead-of-time when they are installed and site files
;; are compiled when gccemacs is installed.
(when (and (fboundp 'native-comp-available-p)
	   (native-comp-available-p))
  (setq native-comp-deferred-compilation nil)
  ;; Silence compiler warnings as they can be pretty disruptive
  (setq native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors nil))

;; In Emacs 27+, package initialization occurs before `user-init-file' is
;; loaded, but after `early-init-file'. Doom handles package initialization, so
;; we must prevent Emacs from doing it early!
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Another trick from DOOM

            noninteractive

    ;; `file-name-handler-alist' is consulted on each `require', `load' and
    ;; various path/io functions. You get a minor speed up by unsetting this.
    ;; Some warning, however: this could cause problems on builds of Emacs where
    ;; its site lisp files aren't byte-compiled and we're forced to load the
    ;; *.el.gz files (e.g. on Alpine).
    (setq-default file-name-handler-alist nil)
    ;; ...but restore `file-name-handler-alist' later, because it is needed for
    ;; handling encrypted or compressed files, among other things.

      (setq file-name-handler-alist
            ;; Merge instead of overwrite because there may have bene changes to

              (redisplay))))

;; From DOOM
;;
;; NOTE: In DOOM these are defined in another file, not in early init, that's horrible because
;; starting a client where this settings are defined later causes a little flash at startup (before redisplay)
;; where menu-bar is present.
;;
;; Not calling `menu-bar-mode', `tool-bar-mode', and
;; `scroll-bar-mode' because they do extra and unnecessary work that can be more
;; concisely and efficiently expressed with these six lines:
(push '(menu-bar-lines . 0)   default-frame-alist)
(push '(tool-bar-lines . 0)   default-frame-alist)
(push '(vertical-scroll-bars) default-frame-alist)
(push '(internal-border-width . 8) default-frame-alist)

;; And set these to nil so users don't have to toggle the modes twice to
;; reactivate them.
(setq menu-bar-mode nil
      tool-bar-mode nil
      scroll-bar-mode nil
      column-number-mode t
      fringe-mode 10)

;; UTF-8 coding system.
(set-language-environment "UTF-8")
;; (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)

;; Minor message for gc after loading
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda ()
            (message "Emacs loaded in %s with %d garbage collections."
                     (emacs-init-time) gcs-done)))
