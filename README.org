* Nix & Flakes
This is my *NixOS* and *home-manager* configuration. It aims for maximum reproducibility through *Flakes*, and it's composed by modules to provide plug&play configuration based on hosts and users. At this time the configuration is WIP (I want to polish it).

I'm using the standalone approach for home-manager, but it shouldn't be difficult to integrate all this with the NixOS module.

Be careful if you want to use this "template", this is not a framework neither an easy-come-easy-go library. I'm a totally beginner.
