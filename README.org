* Nix & Flakes
[[https://nixos.org][https://img.shields.io/badge/NixOS-grey.svg?style=flat-square&logo=NixOS&logoColor=white]]

This is my *NixOS* and *home-manager* configuration. It aims for maximum reproducibility through *Flakes*, and it's composed by modules to provide plug&play configuration based on hosts and users. At this time the configuration is WIP (I want to polish it).

I'm using the standalone approach for home-manager, but it shouldn't be difficult to integrate all this with the NixOS module.

Be careful if you want to use this "template", this is not a framework neither an easy-come-easy-go library. I'm a totally beginner.

** Structure
Here the top-level structure of this repository.
I will put a tree like this in every *important* folder.

#+begin_src bash
  .
  ├── flake.lock                  
  ├── flake.nix
  ├── home                        # Home-manager configuration 
  │   ├── configurations          # Configurations, home by home
  │   └── modules                 # Modules :: options to build a cute home
  ├── lib                         # Custom utility functions to reduce boilerplate code
  │   ├── default.nix             
  │   ├── home.nix                # Home configurations generator
  │   └── nixos.nix               # System configurations generator
  ├── outputs                     # Contains sets of possible configurations
  │   └── configs.nix

#+end_src

** Instructions
*** First installation on new hardware
1. Boot into the NixOS installer;
2. Switch to root user;
3. Do your manual partitioning, and mount all (if you don't know how to do this step, go away);
4. Installation process:
   #+begin_src bash
     # This step is mandatory
     nix-shell -p git nixFlakes

     ### Thanks to hlissner for this trick ###
     # Set HOST for the hostname of the new system
     HOST=...
     # Set USER to your desired username
     USER=...

     git clone https://github.com/archer-65/nix-dotfiles /etc/dotfiles
     cd /etc/dotfiles

     # Create a new host folder
     mkdir -p system/configurations/$HOST

     # You have to create a new set in `outputs/configs.nix`
     # Follow the other sets structure.

     # This step generates your hardware-configuration and a basic configuration file
     nixos-generate-config --root /mnt --dir /etc/dotfiles/system/configurations/$HOST
     # You can remove the `configuration.nix` file, follow the other hosts structure to create your own configuration
     rm -f system/configurations/$HOST/configuration.nix
     # [OPTIONAL] You can copy the other files and modify what you want (be careful!), for instance:
     cp system/configurations/mate/{default.nix,options.nix} system/configurations/$HOST/

     git add -A

     # Install
     nixos-install --root /mnt --flake .#$HOST

     # Finally move your files where you want. Example:
     mv /etc/dotfiles /mnt/home/$USER/.dotfiles
   #+end_src
5. Reboot;
6. Change your password;
7. Enjoy;
    
*** Once installed
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I assume you're in the right folder...but it doesn't matter, you can build from github, from other folders or from another planet :).
#+END_QUOTE

If you want to build your home-manager configuration:
   #+begin_src bash
     # Create your own folder with `default.nix` under `/home/configurations`
     cp -R /home/configurations/mario@mate /home/configurations/"${USER}"@"${HOSTNAME}"

     # Modify what you want, then create your set under `/outputs/configs.nix`
     # Switch.
     home-manager switch --flake '.#"${USER}"@"${HOSTNAME}"'
   #+end_src

To rebuild system/home:
#+begin_src bash
  nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#$HOSTNAME
  
  home-manager switch --flake '.#"${USER}"@"${HOSTNAME}"'
#+end_src

** How did I accomplish this?
Well, I "borrowed" many ideas and functions from other repos...learning nix is *really hard*, with a steep learning curve.

However, thanks to:
- [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles/tree/dfa908e06853908e7ca7b3d0318df618b79ca322][hlissner]] :: Doom author, very helpful for the modules idea;
- [[https://github.com/NobbZ/nixos-config][nobbz]] :: This guy is my savior, very clear repo, good separation for home and system;
- [[https://github.com/bbigras/nix-config][bbigras]] :: Nice configuration, I didn't like the folder structure very much, but the config is good;
- [[https://github.com/gvolpe/nix-config][gvolpe]] :: For the useful articles and the crystal clear repo.
